## About

This app is a foundation for a React based browser arcade. The first "game" in the arcade is HeroBuilder, a RPG style game that allows users to create heros with their own unique nickname and class. Users can view their own heros, edit them, and delete them.

### Current state of app:
In the current version I aimed to CRUD all user resources and allow users to create heros. Game logic is a W.I.P.
